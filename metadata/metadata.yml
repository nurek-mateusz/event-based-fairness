name: Social Networks through the Prism of Cognition
description: Reproductory code for the manuscript "Social Networks through the Prism of Cognition". It contains the code to compute CogSNet network state at a given time - here we compute CogSNets at the times of filling the surveys by students (surveydates.csv). The parameter space is defined in modelparameters.csv and communication events are in data/events subdirectory. The program cogsnet-prepare prepares a bash script cogsnet-compute.sh for running the experiments and this script executes the experiments by using cosgnet-compute. Please read the comments at the beginning of the sources of these two files.
