# Data
- `data/eventa.csv` â€“ contains the communication history metadata from the NetSense study (`SenderID;ReceiverID;EventTime`)
- `data/surveys.csv` - ground truth - surveys completed by students who participated in the NetSense study
  - egoid - student ID
  - completed_x (where X is survey number 1-6) - date of the survey completion
  - Survey questions:
    - euthanasia_x - Should euthansia be legal
    - fssocsec_x - Do you think federal spending on social security should increase?
